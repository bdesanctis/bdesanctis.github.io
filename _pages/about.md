Hey, I’m Bianca, a computational geneticist working mostly on ancient and/or environmental DNA. I’m currently a postdoc with [Richard Durbin](https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/research-groups/research-groups/durbin) at the [Department of Genetics](https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge, UK. I’m into population genetics, methods development, molecular ecology, and sometimes even fieldwork.

I grew up in Western Canada. I spent 7 years at the University of Calgary, first for a degree in pure math and statistics, then working in [Jason de Koning](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/jason-de-koning)’s genomics lab as a mathematician. After this I went to the University of Cambridge to do my masters and PhD in mathematical genomics with [Eske Willerslev](https://www.eskewillerslev.com/), [Richard Durbin](https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/research-groups/research-groups/durbin) and [John Welch](https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/directory/john-welch) (2018-2023). Then I did a postdoc at the [Genomics Institute](https://genomics.ucsc.edu/) at the University of California Santa Cruz with [Russ Corbett-Detig](https://corbett-lab.github.io/) and [Beth Shapiro](https://pgl.soe.ucsc.edu/) (2023-2025). I’ve also been an affiliated researcher with the [Center for Geogenetics](https://globe.ku.dk/research/geogenetics/) at the University of Copenhagen since 2020.
