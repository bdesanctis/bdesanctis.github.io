Hey, I'm Bianca, a computational geneticist working mostly on ancient and/or environmental DNA. I'm currently a postdoc with Richard Durbin at the University of Cambridge, UK. I'm into population genetics, methods development, molecular ecology, and sometimes even fieldwork.

I grew up in Western Canada. I spent 7 years at the University of Calgary, first for a degree in pure math and statistics, then working in Jason de Koning's genetics lab as a mathematician. After this I went to the University of Cambridge to do my masters and PhD in mathematical genomics with Eske Willerslev, Richard Durbin and John Welch (2018-2023). Then I did a postdoc at the Genomics Institute at the University of California Santa Cruz with Beth Shapiro and Russ Corbett-Detig (2023-2025). I've also been an affiliated researcher with the Center for Geogenetics at the University of Copenhagen since 2020.
